    <p> During the height of the Great Depression in 1930, Jacob Bloch, a shoe maker by trade, emigrated to Australia from Eastern Europe, bringing with him a profound adoration for music and dance.

Whilst visiting a local dance school, he noticed a young dancer struggling to stay en pointe. He vowed to create a better pair of pointe shoes to help, which is exactly what he did.


During the late 1930s, many overseas ballet companies toured Australia, including the famed Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Bloch created shoes for many of these well-known Russian dancers — including Olga Spessivtseva, Tamara Toumanova, Irina Baranova, David Lichine, Tania Riabouchinskaya and Helene Kirsova — building each bespoke pair to the dancer’s specifications.
